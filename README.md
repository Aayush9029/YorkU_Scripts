> Description: Checks if the site is up and notifies once it's up, so you don't have to check to see if it's up everytime.

> #### Recommended:
1. Download the [python file]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aayush9029/YorkU_Scripts/master/python_scripts/eclass.py)
2.  Run using python3 interpreter

OR 

> One line copy paste in terminal
>
> ```bash
> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aayush9029/YorkU_Scripts/master/python_scripts/eclass.py -s| python3
> ```

> Will work on implementing spyder for better checking..
